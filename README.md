# QuizCPP

This program allows user to play a simple command line quiz. It allows admin to modify and update questions and credentials. This program demonstrates good use of classes and file handling in c++. I made it as a class 12th school project for year 2015-16.

## Getting Started

Clone a copy of this repository locally

### Note:

* Entire code has now been updated to C++11 standard.
* The code is modular and divided into many classes but is still present in a single file so no need to include multiple files. I will divide code in multiple header files in a later commit.

### Prerequisites

* Download and install CodeBlocks IDE with MinGW compiler toolkit from [this link](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries).

### Installing

* Open file ```QuizCPP.cbp``` using CodeBlocks IDE
* Click ```Build and run``` icon on the toolbar
* You can change the ```Build target``` to be ```Debug``` or ```Release```

## Data

* The data folder consists of two files, ```Questions.dat``` and ```credentials.dat```. Do *NOT* modify these files using a text editor.
* To questions in file ```Questions.dat``` are some dummy GK questions.
* To enter admin mode, use name and password as ```admin```
